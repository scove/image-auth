## Proof of Concept for Image based Authentication

This is likely already implemented somewhere by someone else. Fun idea using images rather than numbers or letters (password/phrase) to authenticate. 
Likely does not reduce brute-force as complexity is either the same or lower. Given that we can randomize the matrix however, replay attacks (such as identifying fingerprints on a keyboard and identifying a password/passcode can be mitigated).

## Not to be taken seriously
